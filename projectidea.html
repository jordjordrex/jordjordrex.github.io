    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The project I propose is a 2d space adventure game in which a player who controls a starship explores a randomly generated galaxy. The player will explore the galaxy from a bird’s eye point of view when in a starship. But when on a planet
          will see the world from a side view. Turning the game into a side scroller. </p>
        <p>I am passionate about gaming. It’s a very large industry but is extremely hard to get into. One way to start getting into the industry is by expanding your portfolio by making indie games. These games might not have the budget of a AAA
          title but quite a few of these games end up being fun in there on way. Not many games allow a player to explore a galaxy of planets in a 2d environment. This game is inspired by star trek and stargate. </p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The game will have two modes. One mode being story in which the player is given a quest to find his father who got lost in space. The player will then try and solve puzzles, explore planets and find clues to find the location of the
          players father. In story mode the “Map” will be pre-made. This is so the story can progress easily by placing quests on particular planets that are in predetermined areas on the map. </p>
        <p>The other mode will be endless. The goal of this mode is to explore and survive. Although it doesn’t directly have a story. The mode explains that you the player were sucked into a wormhole and have been transported into a new galaxy. </p>
        <p>The game will feature survival aspects focusing on ship fuel, player health and player hunger. The ship itself will have various systems that can be damaged, upgraded or destroyed. These systems being hyperdrive, weapon systems, life
          support, sensors, shields, power generation, and sub-light engines. The player can gather resources to upgrade his/her ship. The player will also be able to find and use alien ships but can also scavenge special weapons and systems and try
          and retrofit the players main star ship. One such special system that could be found is a clocking device that when used cloaks the ship from enemy sensors allowing the player to approach a planet that might be controlled by a hostile alien
          race.</p>
        <p>The game will also feature a variety of plants, animals and intelligent alien species. The intelligent species will have 3 different kinds of feeling towards the players. This system decides how the alien reacts to the player. Most alien
          species will start off neutral. How the player reacts around these alien’s affects how they will react. One example of this working in such a game would be as follows “the player tries communicating with the alien using the universal
          translator however the player accidently offends the alien. This make the alien hostile towards the player” When the alien becomes hostile, they will try and kill the player. </p>
        <p>Planets will have various types of environments. Some planets will be lifeless while others covered in life. Planets can also have various types of biomes. Such Desert’s, Jungle’s, Forest’s and various other ones. These are affected by the
          planet’s climate for instance a cold planet will not have tropical rainforests. While a hot planet might have no water and be completely covered in sand. These environments may different atmospheres for instance one may be toxic relying on
          the player using oxygen tanks while another may be breathable. </p>
        <p>An autosave system will be in place to make sure someone doesn’t lose their progress. This would save the game every 5 minutes. Players can also manually save if required. They can have multiple saves on different playthroughs. Allowing
          the player to both have a story and endless mode saves at the same time.</p>
        <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
        <p>The game will be developed in Unity Engine. This allows for rapid prototyping of the product. Coding will be done in Visual Studio as this is the best IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for C# programming. GIMP will be used for the
          creation of sprites. This because it’s open source and free. Other programs such as photoshop could be used for the creation of sprites. GitHub could also be used for a repository for the code. </p>
        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <p>Knowledge in Unity’s UI will be important as it is a very UI based game development tool. The game will need to be programmed. Unity uses 2 main languages. Those being C# and Unity Script (Which is basically JavaScript for Unity). For this
          project however I will be using C#. C# is a widely documented language allowing myself to have a vast learning resource. I would also need to have knowledge in graphic design for graphical assets such as sprites. If GitHub is used for a
          repository knowledge of using the unity extension called “GitHub for Unity” would be helpful. </p>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>If the project is successful. I will have a better knowledge in game development and how it works. Although the project might be to big of an idea. Using an iterative approach meaning that the game starts of small then over time constantly
          gets updated with new features as I learn new concepts in game development. The game could also be put onto a game marketplace such as steam and sold. </p>
