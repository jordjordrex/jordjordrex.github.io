<h1>Welcome to my profile!</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Jacob Darling and my RMIT Student ID is s3777780 while my rmit email address is s3777780@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>My interest in IT started at a very young age when I was given my first computer. Since then I have always enjoyed using computer whether its for gaming, learning or just watching some videos on YouTube. I have used multiple programming languages such as Python and C# but I have mainly used Java as it was the main language used during computer science at college.</p>
<p>I studied computer science in college which I enjoyed. After college I wanted to go to a university living in Tassie, I only had the choice of UTAS. After lots of research I found OUA (Open Universities Australia) and the RMIT degree. This looked like a better choice for me If I could stand online learning, so I decided to give it a try. </p>
<p>I want to further improve my knowledge of I.T. I am interested in the software development side of I.T but also, I am fascinated by the systems administrative side of I.T. I want to make a career out of this.</p>
